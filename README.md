Capstone Project
Portfolio project

The Capstone Project is the culmination of my journey in the “Intro to Software Engineering” course, where I will apply my newly acquired skills in HTML, CSS, Python, MySQL, JavaScript, and Flask to build a practical and functional web application. This project serves as an opportunity for me to showcase my proficiency in software engineering principles and demonstrate my ability to create a complete web application from scratch.

The purpose of the Capstone Project is to provide me with a real-world development experience, simulating the challenges and complexities that software developers often face in their professional careers. Throughout this project, I will showcase my problem-solving abilities, project management skills, and creativity in designing and implementing a fully functional web application.
